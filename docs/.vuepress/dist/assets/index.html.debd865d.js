We chase the metaverse, chase a dream-like &quot;beautiful new world&quot;, but we can&#39;t get out of Samsara. We move from one place to another, caught in an endless cycle. Samsara Labs was founded for the purpose of finding companions on the go, and we will explore the Web3 in a soul-binding way.</p><h2 id="origin" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#origin" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Origin</h2><p>Today we are surrounded by all kinds of cryptocurrencies and NFTs, people come and go because of wealth, but often lose faith in the Web3 world. Crypto is punk, we launch a challenge to the old world, we launch a challenge to the old money</p><p>Samsara means that we keep repeating ourselves, but at the same time we keep surpassing ourselves to reach a higher level, and it is in such a process that human civilization keeps moving forward.</p><p>We are a group of pathfinders of advanced technology. We are committed to helping more Web3 users around the world to experience the beauty of encrypted art and promote multicultural integration. Therefore, Samsara Labs is a project born out of this goal and ideal. We want a group of like-minded people to build a community of our own through DAO governance and share the common achievements.</p><h2 id="a-vision-of-the-future-plans" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-vision-of-the-future-plans" aria-hidden="true">#</a> A vision of the future plans</h2><p>Samsara Labs will build on blockchain technology by open-sourcing all code, gradually issuing decentralized NFT and governance Tokens, and will eventually become a fully decentralized community project where DAO governance will determine her direction.</p><h3 id="nft-projects" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nft-projects" aria-hidden="true">#</a> NFT projects</h3><p>We will issue some rare NFT items in the community, as the basis of our community building, a kind of certification for members</p><p>MatchesGirls will be our first NFT project, which is our official collaboration with Hans Christian Andersen&#39;s Fairy Tales, and we hope that members of the community will enjoy it!</p><h3 id="dao-governence" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dao-governence" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DAO governence</h3><p>We are considering issuing DAO Tokens in the near future as an incentive and recognition based on the level of contribution of the community members, probably non-tradable tokens in the initial stage, mainly for voting governance.</p><h3 id="gamefi-development" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gamefi-development" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Gamefi development</h3><p>When the community grows and matures, we will start the development of Gamefi and build some economic models to further grow the community and make it valuable and viable for a long time</p><h3 id="the-samsara-metaverse" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-samsara-metaverse" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Samsara Metaverse</h3><p>When the above conditions are ripe, it is time to start our Samsara metaverse project to involve a wider range of members from outside the community in community building and community life. The metaverse represents our dream, we want the avatar to be bound to our soul, we will cooperate with mature did service providers, so that everyone can realize their value in the metaverse as well.</p><h2 id="community-operations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#community-operations" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Community Operations</h2><p>Samsara Labs cares about every member of the community, we are of the community, for the community.</p><h3 id="role-governance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#role-governance" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Role Governance</h3><p>In the community, we will assign different roles according to members&#39; contributions, activity, and participation in activities, most of these roles are commemorative in nature, but also have some special rights and interests, such as the NFT Holder exclusive channel.</p><p>We have an initial team of web3 entrepreneurs from all over the world, and we will promote a progressively decentralized community structure, and when the community is completely decentralized, it will no longer need a clear &quot;leader&quot; and will be fully autonomous and self-running.</p><h3 id="project-system" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#project-system" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Project system</h3><p>Community building needs to operate on a project system, where each project can be initiated by members of a specific identity group, voted on broadly by the community, and built by a project team.</p><h3 id="activities-and-benefits" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#activities-and-benefits" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Activities and Benefits</h3><p>The important identity of the community will be bound to the individual through NFT, which will be used as a unique authentication pass when we organize offline activities. At the same time, we will cooperate with traditional companies in exchange for commercial benefits, such as special merchandise vouchers, coupons and other benefits directly to the community through the NFT.</p><p>Subsequent NFT project whitelists or airdrops will be generated from addresses in the previous order of projects and from people who have contributed to the community.

We will record the contributions of our community members and provide appropriate incentives.</p><p>DAO governance will be the ultimate form of community, a decentralized community must be highly autonomous and democratic, and we will always work to guard and facilitate this process.</p><h3 id="metaverse-pass" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#metaverse-pass" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Metaverse Pass</h3><p>Holding NFT as a pass to Samsara Metavers would be a good idea, but in order to embrace the traditional world more broadly, we hope that our NFT should not be the only threshold, but should emerge as an important asset in the metaverse.
